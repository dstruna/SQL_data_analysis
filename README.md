# ðŸ“Š SQL Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ§  Project Summary
This project is part of my journey to become a Data Analyst. I got the data on Kaggle. I downloaded the data and did a bulk import into MSSQL. I used SQL to analyze a dataset of Sample Superstore. Then I made a visualization from the queries in Tableau Public.

## ðŸ”§ Tools
- MSSQL
- Tableau (for final visualization)

## Data Source
Sample Superstore: [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roopacalistus/superstore).
The dataset contains sales details of different stores of a supermarket chain that has multiple stores in different parts of the US.



## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Get data
- Import data to MSSQL
- Answer specific business questions using SQL
- Visualize key insights

## ðŸ“ˆ Key questions that i answered
1. Which state has the highest sales?
2. Which sub_category has the highest profit?
3. Which states are generating losses?
4. What is profit per unit in each sub_category?
5. What is Margain ratio per each sub_category?
6. Does a higher discount reduce profit?
